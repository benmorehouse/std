STD Issues to fix in ver 3.0:
sort the keys that you display in terms of alphabetical order using a data structure 
Will use a Trie for this so go through and do this with your data structues course
need to create the list rename function 
need to create some sort of notepad section to list the available notes that you are working on 
make something that will show all of the aliases that you have made for std 
You could also come up with something that will let you send this note to someone via an imessage or email 
figure out how you are gonna sort the strings 
	You could build an AVL tree that is a link to all of your buckets and such within notes. This would ensure that you are able to get more meaningful experience 
	Look at a way that you can send some sort of message very easily using imessage 
	If there for some reason is any sort of error message then you should be able to read the command line return and based off what it says you could make the computer do other things 

Build a web crawler that can crawl the internet and take data from websites using goquery. This will be good for 
Make your CLI for sending messages
Make a CLI about URL Shortening 
Make a github CLI
Make a google sheets editing CLI - can then use this with imessage-bot
Build somthing that can be a vim client for editing google docs and google files - jon specifically said to build one for using google sheets
	can use csv file manipulation and also an API that he was talking about for stuff like that
Make some sort of product that can take in an arbitrary amount of strings whether it be an API or whatever and just have it sort strings
Make something in go that will notify me everyday and send me a text saying if i had committed or not and if i send something back, it will
Make a github client in docker that will allow for a synchronous installation of all github repos that you have
Make a CLI where  you can keep track of your day
