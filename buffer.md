	STD Issues to fix in ver 3.0:
		sort the keys that you display in terms of alphabetical order using a data structure 
		Will use a Trie for this so go through and do this with your data structues course
		need to create the list rename function 
		need to create some sort of notepad section to list the available notes that you are working on 
		make something that will show all of the aliases that you have made for std 
		You could also come up with something that will let you send this note to someone via an imessage or email 
		figure out how you are gonna sort the strings 
			You could build an AVL tree that is a link to all of your buckets and such within notes. This would ensure that you are able to get more meaningful experience 
		Look at a way that you can send some sort of message very easily using imessage 
		If there for some reason is any sort of error message then you should be able to read the command line return and based off what it says you could make the computer do other things 

	Could make a surver that could send me my workouts whenever I set it. 
		Could talk to money about how to add GIS features 
	Add zoom in alias for everytime you start terminal
	finish the data structures course that you have yourself signed up for
